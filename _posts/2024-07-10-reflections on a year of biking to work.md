Starting in July 2023, I biked to work five days a week, for about 2 miles each way. That comes out to somewhere around 1000 miles, maybe a bit less accounting for sick days and incidental and occasional (but appreciated) rides from my girlfriend. With a total of two bikes used (the first was stolen) this was absolutely economical and enjoyable.

Granted, my bicycle commute is possibly one of the most idyllic in America. Almost entirely on a designated path along a river, only on a road for the final ~30 yards. This wasn't on accident though. I chose my apartment exclusively because of the proximity and pleasantness of the commute, and likely paid extra for it. That was a non-negotiable part of my housing choice. 

I did this every day, rain or shine, snow or sleet, and I think some of my favorite days were the ones with the worst weather. A few highlights:

Drenching rain in a t-shirt soaked to the bone, passing a similarly dressed runner absolutely beaming the same way I was as my music blasted in my ears and I sprinted the full 2 miles.

A late freeze in January with temperatures in the teens and a thin layer of ice on the trail. Any time I put too much force into the pedals my rear wheel would spin out. Fell three times during this freeze but wouldn't trade the experience for a more pleasant one.

Getting passed by a full racing peloton on my casual ride to work, and completely gassing myself to almost keep up for a few minutes.

None of these experiences were advisable, but they were all fulfilling, enjoyable, and mine.
