I think this blog will have 2 main kinds of posts: essays and updates. Essays will follow the rules below, while updates are more casual, basically just Instagram posts.  

This is the set of rules I am making for my own personal blog. They serve a useful purpose in preserving and protecting the things I write from my future self, as well as creating guidelines to facilitate creating more. These are in no particular order, and really only apply to my essays.  

# Rule 1
### Don't edit, don't delete  

This rule might be one of the hardest to follow. It's hard to read something written by my past self and not change something or want to get rid of it all together. Unfortunately, while I want this blog to change and grow, I also want you to be able to see the ways that I have changed and grown as a person and a writer. 
Almost more importantly than that though, if something can be edited in the future, it's never truly done. I want my works to be done when I decide they are, so I can move on to other things.

# Rule 2
### Write for an audience 

Aka, dance like someone's watching. While I doubt this blog will ever get much traffic, I want it to be a blog and not a journal. I already have a journal to journal in. As such, I want my blog posts to be edited, semi-professional, and as well written as I am capable of.

# Rule 3
### This blog does not have a topic, but it is strictly non-professional.  

This is a blog about my interests, not a job application or any kind of pitch for employment. The reasoning behind this rule is to address a conundrum I've had with this website, deciding whether it is personal or professional. Through this rule, I am making this blog and this site a place for me to express myself, devoid of the need to make money or cater to anyone.
