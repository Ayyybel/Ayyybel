It's a little bit macabre that someone my age, 23, is thinking about legacy with much intensity. It should be a topic for the elderly, the older, and those who've accomplished something. One should begin thinking about legacy in their donations to colleges, not as they graduate from them.

It's prompted, I believe more and more, by the aggressiveness by which we are swallowed by the cultural consciousness. By the temporality of everything being done at the moment. The need to be seen and make a mark is stronger than ever, and I think it's part of what is driving people to higher and higher extremes. In a room where everyone is screaming, how can one be heard?

I think the true, most effective answer is that you ignore the room. You find a small group or community, and without making so much as a ripple in the screaming ocean of the culture, you leave a strong mark on a select few that will be felt for years.

The problem with that, of course, is that once one has been exposed to the screaming ocean, seen the heights that can be reached, such a small impact no longer feels like enough. Our expectations are scaled out of proportion with our fates, and our instinct is to strive for the greatest heights possible, ignoring the smaller, attainable, and comfortable peaks on the way.

If you shoot for the moon and you miss, you'll end up in the void, freezing and forgotten.

This leaves us with a problem. Countless hopelessly ambitious individuals with no interest in the small stuff. The dreamers, I've seen them called. They are championed in our advertising, encouraged to keep dreaming bigger and bigger, with the newest SaaS solution to support them. And so they dream, bigger and bigger, their ideas growing larger and more impressive, and when they look back after they've created their masterpieces, there's no one watching.

It's always been our problem, as a species. In the more distant past, we couldn't choose what would be preserved for posterity. Whatever fell into a peat bog or happened to be made of the right concrete or depicted the right religion was saved, for the future to learn from. We used to rely on luck to determine what the future would know of us.

Now, in an age where our net output of information is scaling exponentially, we are using something's ability to capture attention en masse to determine if it should be saved. At least it's better than pure luck, but there's no way it's preserving our best.

This form of legacy - our creations' survival into the future - has created a twisted incentive, where in order to be remembered, we need to create something that will capture the most attention possible. When something is created only to capture attention, not provide value, we have a problem where things that aren't useful are preserved, and things of real importance are forgotten in their place.
