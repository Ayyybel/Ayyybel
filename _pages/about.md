## Biography

I'm from Port Townsend, Washington, and went to college at WWU in Bellingham. I got my degree in Marketing with a minor in Business Analytics. After getting my degree, I converted my senior year internship into a job, where I became a marketing coordinator at the University of Washington Bothell Dining Program under Aramark. I moved to Woodinville, WA and commuted to work by bike for almost a full year.
After that year had passed, I traveled Europe solo for 3 months, and then returned to my parents to help with the house and apply to jobs.

## Values

The two things that are foundational to the way I want to live my life are Learning and Creation. To learn new things is to grow yourself, and to create new things is to grow others. By doing both fervently, I will improve the world and myself, which will be fulfilling.

## Hobbies

My current active hobbies are weight lifting, creating digital art, and occasionally juggling. I enjoy joining volleyball leagues and playing somewhat competitively. I read as much as I can, and end up playing video games with friends often.
In the past, I've had many other hobbies such as drone racing, mountain biking, bike polo, slacklining, climbing, and snowboarding. For now, these are on the backburner as they require more money, time, or friends to do them with than I currently have.

## Art

I enjoy creating things in many different forms. The things I've created include this website, my portfolio of 3d art, various video games, some furniture, and various songs. I enjoy the process of creating and improving. I think of my art and creations as something that will eventually become a second career, but I am in no hurry to get there.

## Work

For now, I am a marketer. I am business minded, and have a high level of interest in optimizing processes, economics, finance, and start-ups.
I have worked as a social media coordinator, and as a brand manager for a startup. I've filled a wide variety of roles, from writing blog posts and managing ad campaigns to running accounts payable.
In the field of business, I want to redirect my efforts towards finance, specifically business analytics, my college minor.
