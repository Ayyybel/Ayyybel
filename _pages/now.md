I recently moved from Port Townsend to Seattle (Udistrict). It's been amazing so far. I recently quit my retail job at Uniqlo in favor of a hybrid remote job at an accounting firm. I've just started, and am figuring the job out. Also, going on some hikes and playing tennis with a friend I made working at Uniqlo. I've been reading a bunch more books recently also.

I want to figure out some new goals for myself, as I've been very focused on getting onto this career track. I am reluctant to rush it though, and hope they'll present themselves somewhat organically. For now, I'll keep making my posters, seeing friends, and reading.

Further down the line (2028) I am considering starting a masters program, probably an MBA with a focus in finance or economics.
