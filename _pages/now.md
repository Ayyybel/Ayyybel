###### Last Updated: 3.1.2025

Returned from traveling europe for 3 months and now living back at my parents and working at a wine bar as I search for a career job. 
I've been working on a few game jams with friends, creating art, building this website, working out, and taking advantage of my hometown having easy access to sailboats.
I have been feeling fit, strong, connected to my art, and a bit stuck in port townsend. 
I am losely planning a move to chicago, though where I go next very much depends on what job I get. 
Further down the line (2028) I am considering starting a masters program, probably an MBA with a focus in finance or economics.
