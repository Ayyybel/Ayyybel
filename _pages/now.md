I recently moved from Port Townsend to Seattle (Udistrict). It's been amazing so far. I got myself a retail job to pay for rent, and have been going to parties, connecting with friends, and otherwise getting out there.
My current job is serviceable, but the schedule is inconvenient for having an active social life, and the high hours, while nice for saving money, aren't really conducive to what I'm trying to do here in Seattle.
I've been spending less time in nature as a result, but am enjoying reading (currently infinite jest), going for walks, and living with friends. 
I'm currently working on a game with my roommates, doing a poster-a-day project for october, and trying to do one major social event per weekend. 
My loose plan for this next year includes finding a finance or marketing related job that pays better than retail, and creating more art than ever before. 

Further down the line (2028) I am considering starting a masters program, probably an MBA with a focus in finance or economics.
