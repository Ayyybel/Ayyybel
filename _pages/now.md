I moved from Port Townsend to Seattle (Udistrict) about a week ago. It's been amazing so far. I got myself a retail job to pay for rent, and have been going to parties, connecting with friends, and otherwise getting out there.
I've been spending less time in nature as a result, but am enjoying reading (currently infinite jest), going for walks, and living with friends. 
I'm currently working on a game with my roommates, doing a poster-a-day project for october, and going to one major social event per weekend. 
My loose plan for this next year includes finding a finance or marketing related job that pays better than retail, and creating more art than ever before. 

Further down the line (2028) I am considering starting a masters program, probably an MBA with a focus in finance or economics.
