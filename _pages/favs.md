Websites - Right here!
This is a small collection of peoples personal sites that I've drawn inspiration from in the past, or admire greatly!
- [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), who's site was one of my early introductions to "the indie web."
- [Jack](https://jackis.online/), a very cool designer/artist guy who's doing a great job creating a small community.
- [myklemorphosis](https://b0kstudio.wixsite.com/blog), a very cool and unique site, but which now seems to be under maintenance or deprecated. Check it out on the waybackmachine.
- [ivysly](https://ivysly.com/) a really interesting game developer with a unique style.
- [medg](https://medg.com.ar), especially their [poster project](https://medg.com.ar/Posters-Project). It's an unending source of inspiration, and the kind of thing I want to undertake.
- [mogdogblog](https://www.mogdogblog.com/home), creator of nubbys number factory, and a site I really enjoy the vibe of.
- [Bill Wurtz](https://billwurtz.com/), maybe the first personal site I ever visited, and a joy to explore.
- [jvscholz](https://jvscholz.com), a guy with a pretty interesting productivity-focused youtube channel, and a site with lots of depth and useful information.
