## Websites 
This is a small collection of peoples personal sites that I've drawn inspiration from in the past, or admire greatly!
- [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), who's site was one of my early introductions to "the indie web."
- [Jack](https://jackis.online/), a very cool designer/artist guy who's doing a great job creating a small community.
- [myklemorphosis](https://b0kstudio.wixsite.com/blog), a very cool and unique site, but which now seems to be under maintenance or deprecated. Check it out on the waybackmachine.
- [ivysly](https://ivysly.com/) a really interesting game developer with a unique style.
- [medg](https://medg.com.ar), especially their [poster project](https://medg.com.ar/Posters-Project). It's an unending source of inspiration, and the kind of thing I want to undertake.
- [mogdogblog](https://www.mogdogblog.com/home), creator of nubbys number factory, and a site I really enjoy the vibe of.
- [Bill Wurtz](https://billwurtz.com/), maybe the first personal site I ever visited, and a joy to explore.
- [jvscholz](https://jvscholz.com), a guy with a pretty interesting productivity-focused youtube channel, and a site with lots of depth and useful information.

## Blogs, posts, and misc stuff 
- **9-23-25** - [Hosting a Website on a Disposable Vape](https://bogdanthegeek.github.io/blog/projects/vapeserver/) - just a really cool project I wish I had the patience or expertise to pull off. 
- **9-23-25** - [how to live without your phone by samkriss](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/how-to-live-without-your-phone) - I've been slowly making my phone less useful, but am quite scared of the leap it would take to get rid of it fully. Reading about others experiences is always interesting.
- **9-15-23** - [The Cult of Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus) - A video about a (manifesto)[https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13] that I've wholly adopted since it was released. The Cult of Done is an amazing idea that I like to apply as much as possible
