With a total of two bikes used (the first was stolen) this was absolutely economical and enjoyable.">

      <p>Starting in July 2023, I biked to work five days a week, for about 2 miles each way. That comes out to somewhere around 1000 miles, maybe a bit less accounting for sick days and incidental and occasional (but appreciated) rides from my girlfriend. With a total of two bikes used (the first was stolen) this was absolutely economical and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Granted, my bicycle commute is possibly one of the most idyllic in America. Almost entirely on a designated path along a river, only on a road for the final ~30 yards. This wasn’t on accident though. I chose my apartment exclusively because of the proximity and pleasantness of the commute, and likely paid extra for it. That was a non-negotiable part of my housing choice.</p>

<p>I did this every day, rain or shine, snow or sleet, and I think some of my favorite days were the ones with the worst weather. A few highlights:</p>

<p>Drenching rain in a t-shirt soaked to the bone, passing a similarly dressed runner absolutely beaming the same way I was as my music blasted in my ears and I sprinted the full 2 miles.</p>

<p>A late freeze in January with temperatures in the teens and a thin layer of ice on the trail. Any time I put too much force into the pedals my rear wheel would spin out. Fell three times during this freeze but wouldn’t trade the experience for a more pleasant one.</p>

<p>Getting passed by a full racing peloton on my casual ride to work, and completely gassing myself to almost keep up for a few minutes.</p>

<p>None of these experiences were advisable, but they were all fulfilling, enjoyable, and mine.</p>
